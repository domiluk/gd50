These are my attempts to solve the assignments of CS50â€™s Introduction to Game Development course.

Disclaimer 1: Most of the code is not mine, it's been created for the course with the intention that the students will add to it / change portions of it to complete assignments, which is what I've done here.
Disclaimer 2: Do not copy this code for your own assignments. In fact, if you are a student of this course, don't even look at this code.
